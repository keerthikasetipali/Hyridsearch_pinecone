  **Hybrid Search Using RAG with Pinecone**

This repository demonstrates a hybrid search approach using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model integrated with the Pinecone vector database.
The RAG model combines retrieval-based search with generative question-answering, retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating responses to user queries using a pre-trained language model.
Pinecone is used as the vector database for efficient, scalable, and fast dense vector-based retrieval. This integration allows us to store, search, and retrieve relevant information from a large document corpus.

**Overview**


Hybrid Search using RAG and Pinecone enables:

Dense vector retrieval using Pinecone to find relevant passages or documents based on their embeddings.
Question answering by leveraging a language model (like GPT or BART) to generate responses from the retrieved documents.
This approach is ideal for large-scale knowledge bases, offering high accuracy in understanding and answering user queries.

**Key Features**


Integrates RAG for hybrid search (dense + sparse retrieval).
Uses Pinecone for fast and scalable vector search.
Supports retrieval from large document collections, including PDFs, text files, and structured data.
Provides flexibility for diverse types of queries using generative models for answer synthesis.

**Requirements**

The project requires the following libraries:

1.Transformers for the RAG model.
2.pinecone-client for interacting with the Pinecone vector database.
3.datasets for loading and handling data.
4.langchain for retrieval workflows.
5.pytorch for model handling and inference.
6.Ensure you have these installed.

**How It Works**

*Dense Vector Search: Document embeddings are generated using a pre-trained language model and stored in the Pinecone vector index. The RAG model retrieves relevant embeddings from Pinecone based on the query embedding.

*Answer Generation: Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the RAG model synthesizes an answer using its generative capabilities, combining both the retrieved information and its pre-trained knowledge.

*Hybrid Search: RAG enables both dense (vector) and sparse (keyword-based) retrieval for more accurate and context-aware responses.

**Configuration**


To configure the project, make sure to:

1. Set your Pinecone API key in the environment variables or configuration file.
2. Define your Pinecone index name and other parameters in config.json or the scrip
